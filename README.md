# Procedural Map Generation Challenge

Welcome to the Procedural Map Generation Challenge, where an algorithm crafts endless landscapes and dungeons before your eyes. This repository holds the source code for a custom Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, used to generate an infinite series of maps from a set of tiles.

## Overview

The `main` branch of this repository contains the code that's currently running in our YouTube video "Can You Spot the Bug? - Endless Procedural Map Generation." The video showcases the algorithm in action, producing a variety of map layouts from a given tileset.

## The Challenge

While the algorithm successfully generates countless unique maps, there's a subtle bug that sometimes leads to intriguing quirks in the map generation process. We invite you to join the hunt and spot this elusive bug. Watch the maps unfold and see if you can identify the anomaly within the patterns.

## How to Participate

1. **Watch the Video**: Head over to our [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/_FymRzj-u-8) and watch the procedural generation in action.
2. **Spot the Bug**: Pay close attention to the tiles and their arrangement. If you notice anything out of place or peculiar, you might be onto something!
3. **Share Your Findings**: Comment on the video with your observations. Be as descriptive as possible about what you see and where you think the bug is.
4. **Fame Awaits**: The first person to correctly identify the bug will receive a special shoutout in our next video!

## Building and Running

To run the map generation code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BryceWayne/Rays.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Rays`
4. Run the executable: `go run main.go`


Happy bug hunting, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
